# Butterfly-SDM

## Overview

Using observational data (obtained from eButterfly & iNaturalist), species distribution model maps will be computed for ~700 butterfly species in North America using a variety of models & parameter sets over a variety of timeframes. These maps will be used to create 1) an interactive system for viewing distribution maps by species and timeframe, and 2) overall biodiversity map(s) of North American butterflies.
